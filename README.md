CS250 - Software Development Life Cycle

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

- User stories are the vehichle for fulfilling user needs with the product. Through careful manufacturing, user stories guide me in developing code that will fulfill the clients needs and ultimately bring value to them. 

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

- Currently, I take more of a waterfall approach to development where I will try to plan everything from the get go and not start developing untill I have everything in order. I hope to shift slightly more towards agile practices where I can get to developing a little faster and adjust as I go. I also plan to incorporate more creation and developing of self generated user stories going forward throughout the SNHU computer science degree. I believe that this will give me more guided and focused work which will ultimately lead to better programs.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

- To be a good team member there are a couple of traits that come to mind. First, communication is key when working in a team environment. Practicising clear communication with others is critical in helping things run smoothly. Second, challenging ideas and not people is important in creating a healthy work environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts. Lastly, I believe that a good team member should be dependable. Trust is a essential when working in a team environment and dependability helps foster it.
